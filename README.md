# 30-Max
Arcade is Fun

My first game in Unity. <br>
Just uploaded to try git. <br>

<ul type="square">
<li>Did the ray calculations myself.</li>
<li>Most interesting thing was to convert values from unit/frame to unit/sec.</li>
</ul>

<b>Flaws :</b>
1. Ray calculations are very basic. <br>
2. The models used have a million triangles (Didnt knew the rendering concepts at that time). <br>
3. <b><i>And it is monetized :D</i></b>

<i>Dare to go beyond 30.</i>
